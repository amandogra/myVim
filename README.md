#myVim

This is a copy of the .vimrc file which I am using for my Vim. I have started using Vim about an year ago. For initial ramping up I have used (spf-13)[https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim] distribution, which is awesome.
But now the time has come to take more control of my editor and add only those things to .vimrc which I understand or need. In the end, my .vimrc might become similar of that of spf13 or might not. Who cares, the point is I am learning Vim and totally loving it.
Feel free to use this .vimrc if it suits you or better create your own.

A good source for my Vim knowledge is (vimcasts.org)[https://www.vimcasts.org], I highly recommend going though those screencasts. Also vimawesome[vimawesome.com] is a beautiful source for Vim plugins.
